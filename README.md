# Quiz-game-dylandray-CDOF4
Quiz game by Dylan Dray (CDOF4)

This is a quiz game project. In order to play, you should type QuizGame() in the console.
Then you must choose a difficulty (from 1 to 5), and the number of questions (1 to 10)

You must answer to every question within the console. Be aware of uppercases and accents!
For example, Quelle est la capitale du Paraguay ? La réponse est Asunción, not asunción or Asuncion.

You can contribute to this project by solving the uppercases issues (maybe by putting it all in uppercases?) and accents issues (with a dictionary?)
By adding more questions, adding a timer.. There's plenty of things to do!
